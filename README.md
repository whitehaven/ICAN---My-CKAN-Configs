ICAN - My CKAN Configs

These are the packages I use in CKAN for Kerbal Space Program. Due to the complex interplay of different mods, these change  with updates and must be fixed continually. That and tweaks for performance.

Also, I'm keeping a few mods that aren't on CKAN on here to not have to track them down.
